Caesar Cipher: Encryption/Decryption Tool
A simple implementation of the Caesar cipher encryption and decryption algorithm using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. The Caesar cipher is a substitution cipher that shifts each letter in the plaintext by a fixed number of positions in the alphabet.

Features
Encrypt or Decrypt Text: Choose between encryption and decryption modes.
Customizable Shift Value: Define how many positions to shift letters.
Alphabet Modulo: Adjust the alphabet length (e.g., custom character sets).
Letter Case Options: Maintain original case, enforce lowercase, or uppercase.
Foreign Character Handling: Choose to ignore or remove non-alphabetic symbols.
How to Use
Download: Clone the repository or download the source files.
Open: Launch the index.html file in a web browser.
Set Preferences:
Select Encrypt or Decrypt.
Enter the Shift Value (number of positions to shift letters).
Define the Modulo Value for the alphabet length.
Choose a Letter Case Option: maintain case, lowercase, or uppercase.
Handle Foreign Characters: choose to ignore or remove non-alphabetic symbols.
Input Text: Enter the text to be processed in the input field.
Submit: Click the Submit button.
View Results: The processed text will appear in the output section.
Examples
Encryption
Input: "HELLO"
Shift: 3
Output: "KHOOR"
Decryption
Input: "KHOOR"
Shift: 3
Output: "HELLO"
